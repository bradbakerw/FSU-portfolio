                        Either way, I have an appreciation for music and I've spent the last 10 years of my
                        academic career studying it. I hope this has been insightful, or at least interesting!</p>

                           For many years music was considered among the
                           Math and Science subjects. It is only a relatively recent
                           phenomenon in history that music has branched into being
                           seen more as an art.

                            Musicians use many parts of their brain simultaneously. While a musician is
                        performing, they are continually counting rhythm, calculating note lengths, visually
                        and audibly observing their surroundings to connect and syncronize their
                        sound with fellow performers, and making artistic and cretive decisions about their
                        own playing. In addition, they are relying on <span>muscle memory</span> to press the
                        right buttons, slide to the right positions, or manipulate their
                        oral shape correctly to produce the desired sound on their instrument or voice.

                            Music is a growing and changing discipline. Though some aspects of music seem to be well established
                        in many years of history, the artistic nature of it demands for itself a freedom to grow and change
                        as each rising musician creatively inputs their ideas through composition, performance, critique. The term "Music Theory"
                        suggests the fluidity of the structure of music, because though it's well established, there is no necessarily right or
                        wrong way to do it. This makes for subjective evaltuation of quality, and a wide variety of taste and preference. We can see this
                        represented today by the diverse and still further diversifying selection of music available in the media.
